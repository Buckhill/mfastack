# Potential applications to integrate with MFAStack

Any e-commerce platform, or any other software platform that relies on logged in users is a good candidate to integrate with MFAStack

These include: 

- Magento - a large eCommerce open-source platform
- Drupal - popular PHP open source CMS
- WordPress - popular open source blogging platform with a history of security issues
- Typo3 - enterprise Open Source CMS

The mentioned software has a potential to reach a wide audience of people and integrating with MFAStack would be trivial and quick due to the REST interface and optional SAML integration (existing plugins are available for SimpleSAMLphp)
