# REST API

The REST API which MFAStack exposes is documented using [Swagger](http://swagger.io). 
Since Swagger docs are dependent on a working server, to access full interactive, working documentation - please install MFAStack and direct your browser to `https://your.mfastack.domain/api` (where naturally, `your.mfastack.domain` is the hostname where MFAStack is installed and reachable).
